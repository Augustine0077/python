# A conditional expression in Python, also known as the ternary operator, 
# provides a concise way to write an if-else statement on a single line.
#  It evaluates a condition and returns one value if the condition is true, 
# and another value if the condition is false.

# This is the conditional expression in python just remeber the formula

# return x if condition else y
